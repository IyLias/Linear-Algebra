# Linear Code

[n,k] linear code C over a finite field F is a k-dimensional subspace V of the 

vector space over F.

The members of V are called the code words.

## Property

  - A q-ary [n,k,d] code is also a q-ary (n,pow(q,k),d) code

  - Let u,v E C, then u+v E C for all u and v in C (closed under addition)
  
  - au E C for all u E C ( a E GF(q)) ( closed under multiplication)


## Generator Matrix

In [n,k] linear code, multiplying message,which is length k with generator matri

x,which is kxn matrix makes code length n.



## Parity Check Matrix
