# Linear Code

(n,k) linear code over a finite field F is a k-dimensional subspace V of the 

vector space over F.

The members of V are called the code words.


## Generator Matrix

In (n,k) linear code, multiplying message,which is length k with generator matri

x,which is kxn matrix makes code length n.
